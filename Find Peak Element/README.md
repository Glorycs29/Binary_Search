# [🤔Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/) 

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
#
### 😉Example 1:

- Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
- Output: 2
- Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
 #
### 😉Example 2:

- Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
- Output: 5
- Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
